## Testing Forums Without Login

### Test Steps:
1. **Clear Authentication State**
   - Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Clear session storage: `sessionStorage.clear()`
   - Clear cookies (if any)

2. **Test Forum Access**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/forums`
   - Check if forum threads load
   - Verify category filtering works
   - Test search functionality

3. **Test Authentication Features**
   - "Login to Post" button should be visible (instead of "Start New Discussion")
   - No delete buttons should be visible on threads/replies
   - Clicking "Login to Post" should redirect to login page

4. **Test Thread Detail Page**
   - Click on any thread to open detail page
   - Thread content should be visible
   - Replies should be visible
   - No delete buttons should appear
   - "Login to Reply" should be shown instead of reply form

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Forums should load and display threads
- ✅ Users can browse and read threads/replies
- ✅ Search and filtering should work
- ✅ No delete buttons should appear
- ✅ Login prompts should appear for interactive features

### Common Issues:
1. **Auth Loading State**: AuthContext might be blocking render
2. **Firebase Rules**: Firestore rules might be too restrictive
3. **Component Guards**: Components might be checking auth state too strictly
4. **Hook Dependencies**: useUserRole might be causing issues

### Quick Fix:
If forums don't load without login, try clearing browser storage and hard refresh:
```javascript
// Run in browser console
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
window.location.reload(true);
```
